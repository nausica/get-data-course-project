# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set Cleaning

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  

## Data
A full description is available at the [site] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained and [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) are the data for the project.
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Testing
To test it, you only need to run the R script [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R). It will download the necessary data for you, it will create a new folder (./data) and extract the data there. The output is a file called tidy.txt.
